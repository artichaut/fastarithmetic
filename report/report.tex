\begin{abstract}

  This internship took place during July and August 2016, the aim was to study
  the algorithms presented in \cite{DDS14}, and to implement them in Nemo
  \cite{Nemo}, a computer algebra package for the Julia \cite{Julia} programming
  language. This paper intends to compare the Julia and the C implementations of
  the code, in terms of speed, but also genericity and easyness to write and
  read such code.

\section{A bit of theory}

\section{Julia/Nemo in practice}
Julia is a very easy to learn language, I had never seen Julia code before the
internship, and I am not an expert in computer science, but the writing part of
the code was not the hardest at all. Since it's easy to write, I hope it's also
easy to read, if not, I think that it is due to my lack of experience in
software programing, rather than to Julia itself. You can find the code at
https://gitbub.com/edouardRousseau/FastArithmetic.jl. What's more, it is really
easy to install personal packages too, you just have to clone my repository
inside Julia, using
\begin{verbatim}
julia> Pkg.clone(``https://github/edouardRousseau/FastArithmetic.jl'') 
\end{verbatim}
and you can also test the package easily by running the following.
\begin{verbatim}
julia> Pkg.test(``FastArithmetic'') 
\end{verbatim}
You may want to update the package, because the code is very suceptible to change, so just use
\begin{verbatim}
julia> Pkg.update()
\end{verbatim}
and you will be ready to start again. The code written in FastArithmetic.jl is
very generic, thanks to the type system of Julia, and works for fields
$\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ with a small $p$ as well as large $p$. More importantly, the
\emph{jit} compiler creates a function for each kind of $p$. Indeed the elements
of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ have type \textbf{fq\_nmod} for $p$ small or \textbf{fq}
for $p$ large, so one can write only one function and have two compiled
functions : one for each type, which will be optimized by the compiler for this
type. We will now look at the speed of the code in Julia, and compare it with
the speed in C. In the following, $m$ will be the degree of the polynomial $P$,
which is a precomputed irreducible polynomial obtained by taking random
polynomials of degree $m$ in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[X]$. In the arrays, the speed of
the C code is set to $1.00$, and smaller is better. The speed of of
\textbf{monomialToDual} and of \textbf{dualToMonomial} are the same, either in C
or Julia, so we show the results only for the first.
